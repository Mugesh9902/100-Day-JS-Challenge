Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript - Variables and Data Types


JavaScript Overview: JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It allows you to create dynamic and interactive experiences on websites. Today, we'll start with the basics: variables and data types.

1. Variables in JavaScript

What is a Variable? A variable is a container used to store data values. Think of it as a labeled box where you can store and retrieve information.

Declaring Variables: In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using var, let, or const.

var: Older way of declaring variables. Its scope is either global or function-level.
let: Block-scoped, meaning it's only available within the block it's defined.
const: Also block-scoped, but its value cannot be reassigned after it's set.
Examples:

var name = "John"; // using var
let age = 25;      // using let
const country = "USA"; // using const

name is a variable that stores the string "John".
age is a variable that stores the number 25.
country is a constant variable that stores the string "USA".


2. Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript has different data types to hold different kinds of values. The most commonly used data types are:

String
Number
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Object
Array (special kind of object)

1. String: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Example:

let firstName = "Alice";
let lastName = 'Smith';

2. Number: Numbers in JavaScript can be integers or floating-point numbers.

Example:

let integerNumber = 30;
let floatingNumber = 3.14;


3. Boolean: A boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

Example:

let isJavaScriptFun = true;
let isTired = false;


4. Null: null is a special value that represents "nothing" or "empty".

Example:

let emptyValue = null;


5. Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value has the value undefined.

Example:

let someValue;
console.log(someValue); // Output: undefined

6. Object: Objects are complex data structures used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

Example:

let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30
};
7. Array: An array is a special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Example:

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
3. Basic Operations with Variables
String Concatenation: You can combine strings using the + operator.

Example:

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(fullName); // Output: Alice Smith
Arithmetic Operations: You can perform arithmetic operations on numbers.

Example:

let sum = 10 + 5;  // Addition
let difference = 10 - 5;  // Subtraction
let product = 10 * 5;  // Multiplication
let quotient = 10 / 5;  // Division
Boolean Operations: You can perform logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT on booleans.

Example:

let isAdult = age >= 18;  // true
let canVote = isAdult && isJavaScriptFun;  // true

4. Practice Exercise
Task 1: Declare variables for your name, age, and favorite color. Store appropriate values in them.
Task 2: Create a person object that contains your name, age, and favorite color as properties.
Task 3: Print a greeting message using the variables you created. Example: "Hello, my name is Alice. I am 25 years old and my favorite color is blue."

Example Solution:

let myName = "Alice";
let myAge = 25;
let favoriteColor = "blue";

let person = {
    name: myName,
    age: myAge,
    color: favoriteColor
};

console.log("Hello, my name is " + person.name + ". I am " + person.age + " years old and my favorite color is " + person.color + ".");
